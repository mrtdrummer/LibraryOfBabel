# Welcome to the Library of Babel!

Library of Babel Simulator  A virtual recreation of Jorge Luis Borges’ "Library of Babel" using Python.

This infinite library contains every possible combination of characters.
Every book that has been written or could ever be written exists here.

Enhanced Features:
• Search for text with multiple exact locations
• Find highly similar text variations
• Browse by hexagonal address with perfect consistency
• Explore library structure with all pages listed
• Full text selection and copying capabilities
• Generate random pages from the infinite collection

This implementation ensures perfect bidirectional consistency:
searched text always appears at the same address, and browsing 
that address always returns the same content.

Based on Jorge Luis Borges' "The Library of Babel" (1941).
